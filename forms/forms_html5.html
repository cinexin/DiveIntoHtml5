			<!-- example of the useful "placeholder" attribute in text boxes -->
			<!-- "autofocus" attribute will tell us where to put the cursor when
				the page is loaded...this is not always a good idea (for example,
				for people with special needs like blind people, it can confuse them rather
				than help them...) -->

			<!-- numbers as spinboxes... -->
			<!-- min: minimum acceptable value
				max: maximum acceptable value
				step: acceptable numbers in the range (the default step value is 1)
				value: the default value 
				note: at the time i'm writting this, Firefox doesn't validate this type of field
					and doesn't render it with spinboxes like, for example, Chromium do :-( -->

			<!-- numbers as sliders...-->
			<!-- note: at the time i'm writting this, Firefox and Chromium renders this OK :-) -->

			<!-- dates.. -->
			<!-- note: at the thime i'm writting this, Firefox doesn't render it, 
				unlike Chromium, that renders it fantastically :-( -->

			<!-- note: Chromium renders it in a fancy way, unlike Firefox, that just shows a sad textbox :-( -->
			<input name="time" type="time" />


			<!-- search boxes..-->
			<!-- note: at the time i'm writting this, Chromium uses the "x" to clear
				the text when you type, Firefox doesn't do...except for this...nothing more...
				some urban legends say that Safari renders it with rounded corners...wow!!!-->
			<input name="a_search" type="search" />

			<!-- color pickers...-->
			<!-- note: at the time i'm writting this, Chromium shows us a fancy selector, unlike 
				Firefox, that shows us a sad plain textbox :-( -->
			<input type="color" />
			<input type="submit" value="Submit form" />
